    "### How am i here?\n",
    "Back on early 2020 i was learning Unity3d from its premium subscription and i was suddenly more interested on it. Also while i was doing internship, i learned how to make a commercial chatbots using RASA and deploy it on various platforms. Then i also got interested on text based game where there will be multiple choices and different stories that a player can have. I have not completed(but doing some) any Unity projects yet but i am sharing something useful here and i surely will use these concepts later on real world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will this blog be?\n",
    "This blog will be a gentle introduction to the Unity3d and RASA to make chatbot. <b>Or importantly, deploying a simple RASA chatbot on Android using Unity.</b> I will also give gentle introduction to building Android installation(APK file). <b>Importantly, i am not going to make next Alexa or Siri here.</b> If you are here, then you probably know that Unity is a popular Game Development Platform. And Unity3d is C# based and i heard JavaScript can also be used. Unity3d has very great functionalities and the dev community so learning it will be easier than you think. If you are the one who wanted to learn game development for free but doesn't know where? Then you can follow my below blog for guidance. I am not a pro here but a learner who shares what learns.\n",
    "* [Unity Learn Premium](#)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What will i built?\n",
    "I will test the RASA chatbot framework with Unity's powerful Game Development platform. I will be using Unity's Networking concept on C#, i will only send a single message and then show the sent and received message on a Canvas. The testing will be done on <b>Android Device</b>, but first i will test it on <b>Unity Remote</b>. Unity Remote is a wonderful application available for Android Device, where we can test our developing aplications on UnityEditor."
