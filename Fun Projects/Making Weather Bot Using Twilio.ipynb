    "# Making Weather Bot Using Twilio\n",
    "[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) is a platform which allows us to send SMS, make calls using methods like API calls. It was the begining of COVID crisis and I was living in my village where interent was available by only cellular 3G data. But it is a difficult thing to stay in my village from June to October because the weather is pretty unexpected. One day, I was walking by the village and I saw a huge tomato farm nearly damaged due to wind and the electricity was already gone. Also, my parent's corn farm was highly affected by it. The tomato farm being damaged has something to do with our error like not locking or tightening the farm wires/doors. I thought what if the farmer knew in the morning that the wind or rain is coming in the day. I wrote some codes for myself to backup charge and batteries in the time of electricity cut off.\n",

    "## Prepare Twilio Account\n",
    "First step is to sign up to [twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio). Once completed, a verification mail might be sent to the address. Lets verify that too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, We choose the phone number for the trial period.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](trial.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to choose the type of app, code we are willing to use. Lets chose something like below:\n",

    "![](plan.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Next a dashboard is shown and we can see how much of credit is remaining.\n",

    "And if we scroll to the bottom of dasboard or [twilio.com/console](https://twilio.com/console), we can see the Account SID and Auth Token, we need that to send sms. Next, we will send a sample SMS using this info. But we need to have installed Twilio's helper python library as `pip install twilio`. Or follow the [official instruction](https://www.twilio.com/docs/python/install). Documentation of twilio have recommended to use [secure way (as environment variable)](http://twil.io/secure) of using Auth token and account sid but for the sake of simplicity, I am using those from plain text. Also we need to have phone number to send a sms from. On the console itself, we can get a phone number by simply clicking in `Get a Phone Number`. **Please note that the trial version can only send sms to verified phone number that we've used earlier**."
