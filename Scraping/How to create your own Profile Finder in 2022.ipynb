    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello and welcome back everyone, in this part of the blog I am going to share how can we create our own people finder tool using BeautifulSoup and Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we need people finder?\n",
    "There are lots of benefits of having easier way to find the person. And this might be the best thing for HR companies. Having the list of professionals and their public profile based on their expertise and the experience is one of the rich data. So lets try to make one such data for ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How will we do it?\n",
    "We will automate the search in Search Engine and some search portal like GitHub and then store the result in dataframe then into file. First, we will do google search to find the linkedin profile based on the keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Dependencies\n",
    "For this purpose, we are going to use BeautifulSoup, a python library."
