    "Hello there welcome to the new blog series about Probability in the Data Science field. Here in this blog, we will start from basic concepts needed in using Probability in some datasets. This blog is going to be very short and basic yet informative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is all about measurement of some event's occurrence. We are not far from probability in our daily life. In fact, we have been using Probability from the very beginning of our civilization. Some of best example of probability being unknowingly used can be:\n",
    "* A farmer assuming that if this amount of pesticide will harm to plant itself or only the pests.\n",
    "* A chef assuming that if s/he fried chips for 5 minutes then it will be tasty.\n",
    "* A stock broker can assume that tomorrow's price will rise.\n",
    "* A student believing that studying for 5 hours a day will pass the exam.\n",
    "* A driver hitting brakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list goes on. If we sit down and grab a coffee to think more about this, then there is a high probability that we will not realize there was some probability of thinking about this topic too. Okay now I am making recursive events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminologies Mostly Used\n",
    "### Experiment\n",
    "An experiment is done in some kind of simulated or predefined environment and upon which some outcome is expected and will be calculated. For example a media company will perform some campaign to launch their product based on the outcome. An experiment is called a random experiment when the result of the experiment have various possible outcomes. For example stock price rise/fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event\n",
    "An event is a outcome of an experiment and it can be as simple as the customer buying product or not buying. In coin toss, we can either get head or tail and these two cases are events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exhaustive Cases\n",
    "It is the total number of possible outcomes from an experiment conducted in random manner. For a rolling dice, the possible cases are any of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), but for one dice and a coin toss, the possible outcome will be the (1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 1T, 2T, 3T, 4T, 5T, 6T). In above dice and coin toss example, the case to get head and dice face of even are (2H, 4H, 6H). Upon this, we will calculate the possibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mutually Exclusive Cases\n",
    "What is the possibility of getting head and tail at the same time? None. While occurring one event, if another event's occurrence is affected then those events or cases are mutually exclusive. For example rolling of dice where none of faces can occur at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Space\n",
    "It is the set of all the possible outcome from a random experiment. In a coin toss, it is {$\\phi$, H, T, HT}.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Independent Cases\n",
    "Two events are called independent events if occurring of one has nothing to do with occurring of another. For example, while tossing coin for number of times, the outcome of one toss does not affect outcome of another."
