    "This blog will be using [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/docs/installation/installing-superset-from-scratch) in WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) because the library `apache-superset` has OS level dependency. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Install following packages as `sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python3-dev python3-pip libsasl2-dev libldap2-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev`.\n",
    "* If some packages are missing, `sudo apt-get update` might help out.\n",
    "* Install [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) as `pip install virtualenv`.\n",
    "* Create an environment as `python3 -m venv env_name`. My env_name will be `airflow_env`.\n",
    "* Activate environment as `source path/to/env_name/bin/activate`.\n",
