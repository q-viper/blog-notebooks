    "## Why keras?\n",
    "* Because its like drag and drop for Neural Networks.\n",
    "* No more headache of <b>mathematical complexity</b>\n",
    "* Can customize layers and do training easily.\n",
    "* Has great preprocessing APIs as well as data generators.\n",

    "## What is CNN\n",
    "The answer to this question has been already given by me in following blogs:\n",
    "* [Writing Image Processing Codes from Scratch in Python](): Where I have written some codes to do read, write, convolve images.\n",

    "## Why CNN?\n",
    "* CNN has filters or kernel as learning parameters. Unlike simple neural nets, CNN uses very few parameters. In fact, parameters are shared!\n",
    "* CNN handles feature extracting from images very efficiently.\n",

    "## Basic Terms in CNN\n",
    "* <b>No. channels</b>: ex RGB, Grayscale\n",
    "* <b>Filters</b>: each filter gives a filtered image ie. feature map\n",
    "* <b>Size of filters</b>: it is a square matrix which shape is less than image\n",
    "* <b>Stride</b>: value with which we will skip the convolution\n",

    "* <b>Convolutional layer</b> is the layer where convolution operation happens. Convolution here is same as on image processing where features are extracted. A filter of same row and column or square size is taken and multiplied across the window that fits filter. The element-wise product is done and summed all. We generally use stride, as how much pixel shift after doing one convolution. Also zero padding is done sometime to add zeros. The convolution layer gives number of filters with same properties. Here more the number of filter, more the accurate model can get but computational complexity increases.\n",

    "When a machine learning model has high training accuracy and very low validation then this case is known as over-fitting. The reasons for this can be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The hypothesis function you are using is too complex that your model perfectly fits the training data but fails to do on test/validation data.\n",
    "2. The number of learning parameters in your model is way too big that instead of generalizing the examples , your model learns those examples and hence the model performs badly on test/validation data.\n",

    "1. Use a simple cost and loss function.\n",

    "3. Reduce the number of learning parameters in your model.\n",
