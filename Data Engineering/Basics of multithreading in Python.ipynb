    "Multi-threading in Python is often used when there are tasks related to I/O bound. But before going further, lets take few examples where multi-threading could be used:\n",
    "1. Downloading images from the web and do image processing related tasks. It takes some time to download image and some time to process it too but these two sub-tasks can be run either sequentially or parallelly. Running sequentially has some flaw when our system have multi-threading as our resource will not be using what is available. And another is image processing could take long time and downloading will be paused when processing is going on. But we could run these two tasks in independent threads. One thread will download images from the web and another will process that downloaded image.\n",
    "2. While doing machine learning tasks, we have to work with multiple data and process a lot before sending them to modeling. We could run multiple threads that our CPU supports and then perform pre-processing on them.\n",
    "3. Another application I recently did was for making a back-testing bot. User will make different alerts with rules based on technical indicators and they will try to check if this alert will fire on this time of this day. One can run this test for a long period of time and the data is not related to each other. While testing sequentially, it was quite slow and was not running on full capacity of system. But when I made different threads and ran cluster of different dates, it was surprisingly fast.\n",
    "4. Another I built is also for a trading bot. There will be an API listening to user's request to buy stock option based on strike price, symbol and expiry date. Also we had to us [bracket order](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bracketedbuyorder.asp). I had to keep a track of these orders. So I ran distinct thread for distinct order until they were filled. This way one order runs independently of another."
