    "## Introduction\n",
    "There is huge benefit of using MySQL as a backend database in Airflow. Main reason is that MySQL is widely used in production instead of SQlite. Also, we can have scalable database system where we can have concurrent requests, high security and well defined permission and roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the last few blogs, I've share how can we fully schedule DAGs written in Windows Machine from WSL. And we were using default Database, SQlite on those blogs but later we did connect to MySQL running in Windows from WSL. But in this blog, we will do clean install of Airflow in WSL and we will use MySQL as a Database. This blog is related to some of the previous blogs in some way but it is not required to go there.\n",
