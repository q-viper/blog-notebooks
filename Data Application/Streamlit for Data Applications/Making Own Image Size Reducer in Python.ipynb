    "Image size reducer is much needed tool these days because most site wants us to upload various documents in the form of image but with the size limit. Modern days camera gives us image with size in megabytes but the server or site we need to upload the site has size limitation. There are sites like https://www.reduceimages.com to reduce size online but many have limitations like some have usage limits per day, some have too many ads and some have unfriendly usages. With the mindset to create own image size reducer which could have the features as I want, I am creating one using OpenCV and Streamlit.\n",
