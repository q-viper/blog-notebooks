Once done, we should change the the DNS records especially A and CNAME records. **For the simplicity, I once had one [VPS in Contabo](https://contabo.com/en/) and thus I changed the nameserver of the domain to contabo's nameservers but it is not necessary.** One can use Cloudfare to manage DNS too if using the AWS's EC2 Instance. How to setup DNS is written below.\n",
